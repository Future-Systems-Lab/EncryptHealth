# 🛡️ EncryptHealth™

**Encrypted. Decentralized. Practitioner-Centric Mental Wellness Platform.**

---

## 🌿 What Is EncryptHealth?

EncryptHealth™ is a **privacy-first, decentralized practitioner software** designed for:

✅ **Secure, encrypted communication with clients**  
✅ **Encrypted lab data review and interpretation**  
✅ **Progress tracking without exposing identity**  
✅ **Tokenized, crypto-based payments without insurance**  
✅ **Trauma-informed, naturopathic mental health care delivery**

It enables **clinicians, naturopathic doctors, therapists, and health coaches** to deliver **care, labs interpretation, and follow-up protocols privately and efficiently** without institutional barriers.

## 🚩 Why Practitioners Need EncryptHealth

The current system forces practitioners to:
- Use unsecured email or patient portals tied to insurance.
- Risk HIPAA breaches with every message or lab upload.
- Depend on centralized EMRs that track and sell client data.
- Limit accessibility for uninsured or privacy-conscious clients.
- Avoid sharing advanced naturopathic protocols due to censorship risks.

**EncryptHealth was built to end these barriers.**

## 🔑 Practitioner Features

✅ **Encrypted messaging & video calls** with clients under pseudonymous identities.  
✅ **Encrypted lab uploads & interpretation** while preserving user anonymity.  
✅ **Client progress tracking** using encrypted decentralized storage.  
✅ **Crypto and token-based payment options** replacing insurance dependency.  
✅ **Protocol delivery** directly to clients securely.  
✅ **NFT-based milestone tracking** (optional) to document non-transferable progress.

## 🧩 How It Works

1️⃣ Practitioner creates a **pseudonymous profile** tied to ENS/DID.  
2️⃣ Clients connect via wallet or encrypted ID (MetaMask, WalletConnect, or direct encrypted invite).  
3️⃣ Labs are uploaded securely by clients or practitioner offices for review.  
4️⃣ Practitioner delivers interpretations, protocols, and follow-up plans securely.  
5️⃣ Sessions and services are booked using crypto, stablecoins, or tokens.  
6️⃣ Progress is optionally marked with NFTs to record milestones anonymously.
